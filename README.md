# pa_tomography_xu-wang
Replication of photoacoustic tomography algorithm proposed by Xu and Wang (2005) in Python. This program should operate with the base installation of the free Spyder IDE. If using the command line interpreter, the program will run with modules listed in requirements.txt. You can of course install these packages in one shot using 

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

and doing so in a virtual environment is recommended.
